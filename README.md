# Aotraz's Potions
Made for Livaco's Wizardry addon: https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/wizardry-potion-creation-system

*Might* add some more stuff later. If there's any issues just put it into the tracker.

Config file is located at aotraz_potions\lua\wizardry\items\aotraz_potions\potions\sh_config.lua

My first GLua project with help from the Facepunch wiki and Livaco himself :)


# INSTALLATION

Just place the folder into the addons folder, no need to put it into the Wizardry addon itself.
