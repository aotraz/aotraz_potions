# Aotraz's Potions
Made for Livaco's Wizardry addon: https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/wizardry-potion-creation-system

**IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO CHANGE THE VALUES IN THE CONFIG**

Config file is located at aotraz_potions\lua\wizardry\config\sh_config_aotraz.lua

If there's any issues just put it into the tracker. If anyone has any ideas I could try, you can also put those into the issue tracker as well.

My first GLua project with help from the Facepunch wiki and Livaco himself :)
