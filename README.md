# Alpha Branch
This branch is where I do stuff before I push it to master. I would not recommend downloading this branch.

# Aotraz's Potions
Made for Livaco's Wizardry addon: https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/wizardry-potion-creation-system

Config file is located at aotraz_potions\lua\wizardry\items\aotraz_potions\potions\sh_config.lua


*Might* add some more stuff later. If there's any issues just put it into the tracker. If anyone has any ideas I could try, you can also put those into the issue tracker as well.

My first GLua project with help from the Facepunch wiki and Livaco himself :)


# INSTALLATION

Just place the folder into the addons folder, no need to put it into the Wizardry addon itself.
